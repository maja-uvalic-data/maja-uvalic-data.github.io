                    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        Instacart is an online grocery store that operates through an app. While the 
                        company already has strong sales, they are looking to gain deeper insights into customer 
                        purchasing patterns. The goal of this project is to perform an data analysis of Instacart’s 
                        data in order to uncover customer segments and shopping behaviors. These insights will help 
                        inform a targeted marketing strategy, ensuring that Instacart can reach the right customer 
                        groups with the most relevant products.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Questions</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>What are the busiest days of the week and hours of the day?</li>
                        <li>At what times do customers spend the most money?</li>
                        <li>What are the most common price ranges for Instacart products?</li>
                        <li>Are there specific types of products that are more popular than others?</li>
                        <li>Are there differences in ordering habits based on a customers region?</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Data & Tools</h2>
                    <p>
                        The Instacart dataset consists of several CSV files with millions of rows 
                        containing information about orders, products, aisles, and departments.
                        I used Python and the following libraries:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Pandas</strong> – data cleaning, joining, aggregation</li>
                        <li><strong>NumPy</strong> – numerical operations</li>
                        <li><strong>Seaborn &amp; Matplotlib</strong> – visualizations</li>
                        <li><strong>Jupyter Notebook</strong> – analysis and documentation</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Methodology</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Imported and inspected all CSV files</li>
                        <li>Cleaned the data (missing values, data types, duplicates)</li>
                        <li>Merged tables into a single analysis-ready dataframe</li>
                        <li>Created new features (e.g., order_hour_of_day, order_frequency)</li>
                        <li>Analyzed customer behavior and product demand</li>
                        <li>Visualized patterns with bar charts, histograms, and heatmaps</li>
                    </ol>

                   
                   
                    <h2>Key Insights</h2>
<ul>

    <li>

    <li>

    <li>
        The most popular department is Dairy & Eggs, followed by Produce, Beverages, Frozen, and Canned Goods.

                    <h2>Recommendations</h2>
                    <ul>
                      <li>The busiest periods are Saturday and Sunday from 9 AM to 4 PM, suggesting that marketing campaigns should be scheduled during these peak hours to maximize visibility.</li>
                      <li>Highest spending: 1AM–6AM (with some dips). Promote higher-priced products during these hours when customers are more willing to spend.</li>

                    </ul>
